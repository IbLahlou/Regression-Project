## Introduction

<details>
Studying the correlation between ozone levels and various environmental parameters such as temperature, rain, wind, and natural factors is crucial for understanding the impact of these factors on air quality. Ozone, a major component of smog, is a harmful air pollutant that can have negative effects on human health and the environment. This project aims to analyze the relationship between ozone levels and environmental parameters using statistical techniques and develop insights to improve air quality and reduce ozone pollution.
</details>

## Objective

<details>
The main objective of this project is to analyze the correlation between ozone levels and various environmental parameters. By collecting and analyzing data over time, we aim to identify patterns and relationships between ozone levels and factors like temperature, wind, cloud cover, and rain. This analysis will help us gain insights into the underlying causes of ozone pollution and contribute to the development of strategies to mitigate its adverse effects.

## Variables

<details>
The dataset used in this project contains the following variables:

- MaxO3: Maximum value of ozone observed over a day.
- T9, T12, T15: Temperatures recorded at 9 AM, 12 PM, and 3 PM, respectively.
- Ne9, Ne12, Ne15: Cloud cover measured at 9 AM, 12 PM, and 3 PM.
- Vx9, Vx12, Vx15: East-west wind components measured at 9 AM, 12 PM, and 3 PM.
- MaxO3V: Maximum ozone level observed on the previous day.
- Wind: Wind direction at 12:00 noon.
- Rain: Presence or absence of rain.
</details>

## Data Analysis

<details>
The project follows the below steps for data analysis:

1. Data Importation: Importing the dataset into the analysis environment.
2. Data Cleaning: Preprocessing the data to handle missing values and outliers.
3. Summarize the Data: Obtaining descriptive statistics and gaining initial insights.
4. Visualize the Data: Creating visualizations to understand the relationships between variables.
5. Identify Outliers & Anomalies: Identifying and handling any outliers or anomalies in the data.
6. Test for Relationships: Using statistical tests to identify significant relationships between ozone levels and environmental parameters.
7. Hypothesis: Formulating hypotheses about the factors influencing ozone levels.
8. Realizing Regression: Implementing linear regression models to predict ozone concentrations.
</details>

## Regression Models

The project uses two types of regression models:

1. Simple Linear Regression: Building a simple linear regression model to predict ozone concentrations based on a single environmental parameter.
   - Statistic Studies: Analyzing the statistical significance of the model.
   - Visualizing: Creating visualizations to understand the regression line.
   - Residual Model: Checking the residuals to assess model performance.
   - Prevision of Ozone's Concentration: Using the model for predictions.

2. Multiple Linear Regression: Creating a multiple linear regression model to predict ozone concentrations based on multiple environmental parameters.
   - Statistic Studies: Analyzing the statistical significance of the multiple regression model.
   - Remove Insignificant Variables: Removing variables that are not statistically significant.
   - Prevision of Ozone's Concentration: Utilizing the multiple regression model for ozone concentration predictions.
   - Result Analysis: Assessing model performance through various diagnostic tests.

## Required Python Libraries

Before running the analysis code, ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- numpy: Required for numerical operations and array handling.
- statsmodels: Used for statistical modeling and hypothesis testing.
- Seaborn: A powerful library for statistical data visualization.
- bokeh: Enables interactive and visually appealing data visualization in web browsers.

Install these libraries using the following commands in your Python environment:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install statsmodels
pip install seaborn
pip install bokeh
```

## Conclusion

<details>
The regression analysis will provide valuable insights into the correlation between ozone levels and various environmental parameters. By understanding these relationships, we can develop predictive models for ozone concentrations and potentially study the impact of ozone pollution on air quality, human health, and the environment.
